# Gormandize - A Food Analyzation Tool
A Senior Project done for CSC690 in the Spring 2015 semester.

Gormandize allows you to enter a location and a search term (i.e. 'Pizza' or 'Sushi'), then searches both Yelp and Foursquare to gather information for a visualization across 3 charts. The result is a better way to view and compare restaurants based on ratings, average rating, and number of reviews.

Built by Brendan, Mike, and Kevin.
